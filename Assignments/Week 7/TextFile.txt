Theirs was a true love, thought Tony, one to stand the test of time.
Eva, his soul-mate, was somehow even more beautiful than the day they first met, he realized.
And even though she always seemed to say something interesting, it ultimately didn't matter, as he was happy just to hear her soft, melodic voice.
Someday soon, he imagined, they would have children together, and their love would blossom as a family.
These wonderful thoughts made him feel warm and tingly inside. Suddenly, without warning, Tony was yanked from his daydream by the doorbell.
He let out a long sigh, realizing that that would be the courier with the divorce papers.
